    <p class="short-bio">Currently, I am serving as an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at East West University (EWU), Bangladesh. Before joining EWU, I worked as a researcher at the LINKS Foundation in the Pervasive Technologies Research Area, within the IoT Service Management Unit. Previously, I received my Ph.D. in Computer and Control Engineering from the Polytechnic University of Turin, and my Master's in Computer Engineering from the University of Pavia. My research focused on Social Media Data Integration and Event Management for Smart Cities. Before that, I obtained my B.Eng. in Computer Science and Engineering from Khulna University, Bangladesh. Regarding my Ph.D. research project, I developed a data quality assessment methodology for large-scale knowledge bases. The primary emphasis was on automated knowledge base quality assessment using evolution analysis.</p>
